This project is aimed at attempting to predict future prices of stocks in the India based Nifty 500 stock exchange. With the use of a linear regression type model, the analysis uses training data provided by the exchange to create future predictions for both the volatile and micro changes in value. Due to the nature of the market this data is often very volatile and predictions made can often be difficult to interpret.
