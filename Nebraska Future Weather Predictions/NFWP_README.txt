This project attempts to predict future weather conditions in the Sarpy and Douglas counties in the state of Nebraska over a 10 year period. This data is sourced from NWS stations located throughout the counties previously mentioned. Using a SARIMAX model to build predictions based on the seasonal data provided, it takes a look at future temperatures, predicted highs and lows, and possible precipitation. The project goes on to compare these findings with established studies in the same vein and gives some possible causes and solutions to the changes shown in the data.
