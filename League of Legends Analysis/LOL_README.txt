The purpose of this analysis is to attempt to find the major deciding factor in match outcome based on the bottom lane in a game of League of Legends. Using training data from matches in which some of the highest ranking players on the ladder participated, several variables were taken into consideration. It is the overall goal of this study to see which of these variables, if any, had a major impact on the outcome of the lane itself and the match as a whole.
